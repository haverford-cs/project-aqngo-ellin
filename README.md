- Jason:
- Emily: Determine best hyperparameters for SVC for nearby stations; \
  confusion matrix for one and nearby stations; plot validation curves.

### 12/15/2019 (2 hrs)
- Jason:
- Emily: Determine best hyperparameters for SVC for one station;

### 12/11/2019 (2 hrs)
- Jason:
- Emily: Code to generate confusion matrices and heatmaps.

### 12/9/2019 (2 hrs)
- Jason: Pair training data.
- Emily: Convert labels from continuous to categorical. Output confusion matrix.

### 12/5/2019 (1 hr)
- Jason: Converting training data to contain data for 2 days.
- Emily: Plotting SVR results for different kernels.

### 12/2/2019 (2 hrs)
- Jason: Extract data for one station
- Emily: Split data into train and test;
