- Jason: Converting training data to contain data for 2 days.
- Emily: Plotting SVR results for different kernels.

### 12/2/2019 (2 hrs)
- Jason: Extract data for one station
- Emily: Split data into train and test;
  write code for svr models and predictions

### 11/28/2019 (5 hrs)
- Jason: finish cleaning data. The dataset is now stored in `final.csv` with the number of instances `n=1048185` and number of features `p=7`.

### 11/25/2019 (2.5 hrs)
